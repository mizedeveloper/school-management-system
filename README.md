## 🚀 About the Project

The **Sistema de Educação e Aprendizado (S.E.A)** is a portfolio-focused educational system that simulates a real-world classroom environment.  
It provides a centralized platform for:

- Teachers to manage classes, students, assignments, and incidents  
- Students to participate in multiple classes and submit assignments  
- Administrators to oversee the entire system and manage user accounts  

> **Note:** The interface is in Portuguese, reflecting its intended use in a local school context.

## 🧑‍💻 Users & Roles

### Administrator
- Single admin account: `admin / admin123`  
- Full access to view user passwords for reference (passwords never change)  
- Simple dashboard for account creation and system management  
- Only one administrator exists; multiple concurrent sessions are allowed  
- Credentials should only be shared with trusted users

### Teacher
- Can manage multiple classes with multiple students  
- Creates assignments, activities, and tracks incidents  
- Profile customization with photo  
- Usernames and passwords are **auto-generated** (e.g., `p1, p2...`)  

### Student

## 🔐 Demo Access

- **Administrator:** `admin / admin123`  
- **Teacher / Student:** auto-generated by the system

### ⚠️ Security Notes
- Default admin credentials are for demonstration only; change immediately in production  
- User passwords are stored encrypted in the database but visible in the admin panel for reference  
- Database connection settings (e.g., in `db.php`) and encryption keys (e.g., in `config.php`) are set for local testing and **must be updated** for secure deployment  
- Project is intended for **portfolio and educational use**; further security hardening required for production
